What is a TfidfVectorizer?
                  *TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.

                  *IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
